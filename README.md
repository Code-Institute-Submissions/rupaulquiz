# RuPaul's Best Friend Race: a RuPaul's Drag Race themed quiz app.

This is my third project - an application written in Flask, with the purpose of 
demonstrating my practical Python skills.

commit 1 - initial commit.
commit 2 - base template added, index.html started with basic username 
            submission leading to customised quiz.html



Testing

My first test was to ensure write_player_name functioned correctly. I did this 
with a manual test, by printing {{ player_name }} on the quiz.html page. This
displayed the name correctly, and I also checked in data/players_names.txt that
the names I had submitted had been saved.



Technologies Used

I decided to use the framework of Bootstrap to build a responsive and visually
appealing app - https://getbootstrap.com - and I will maintain a division
between the Bootstrap code and my code by creating a library of used Boostrap
code.
